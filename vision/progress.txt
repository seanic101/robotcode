	1/13/18 was importing numpy, opencv, etc... go to pythonprogramming.net for vision instructions. Got python3.6! yay. got it with repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
	1/16/18 installed numpy, doesn't seem like python 3.6 is in the right place..., sudo apt-get install git and then cloned opencv from github using "git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git", got compiler "sudo apt-get install build-essential", several libraries on pythonprogramming.net haar cascade tutorial as well as some python bindings (same source). Finally, the opencv dev library "sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev", by now writing an opencv script should be ready to go and I can divert from the instructions on haar cascades and instead follow code closer to previous opencv code like on chief delphi. Started writing script? Script needs to take an image and turn down saturation, absorb only a LED Ring Light colored hue range and then find edges etc to recognize the object. Then what to do with that vision is the hard part.
	1/18/18 worked on script and used http://answers.opencv.org/question/86865/vision-tracking-using-retroreflective-tape/, also robotpy
